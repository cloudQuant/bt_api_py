# SimNow CTP Gateway profile (native writes enabled, SimNow only)

`ctp-simnow-trading` is the installed operator profile for the shared, account-level Gateway that strategies reach through their own `config.yaml` (iteration 63, D63-08). It uses the same protected resource bundle as `ctp-local-readonly` (see that document for the file, permission and identity rules) with two differences:

- `settings.write_enabled` may be `true`. Writes are refused at startup with `GATEWAY_WRITE_REQUIRES_BROKER_CONFIRMATION` unless the account key's `venue` and `environment` are both `simnow` (INV63-08: no Gateway writes on other accounts until the broker has confirmed the programme-trading reporting for a shared terminal, D63-22).
- The bundle must contain a `returns` object: `{"instruments": [<MarketInstrumentKey>...], "query_interval_seconds": <seconds>}`. Order dispatch is ready only while these return queries are healthy.

Order dispatch follows user decision B (an admitted order is in flight once its single claim succeeds; a revocation that precedes the claim stops it) and settlement confirmation follows decision A (one durable daily attempt, success only on a trusted readback, an unclear result is read back and never resent). Neither profile proves that the configured fronts, credentials, grants or journal are genuine, and these files do not authorise any account operation.

Offline check (parses the YAML and resolves the installed profile; it does not read the resource file, credentials or network):

```bash
bt-gateway-operator --config ctp-gateway-simnow-trading.example.yaml --dry-run
```

Start (after provisioning the protected bundle; connects to the configured SimNow fronts):

```bash
BT_API_CTP_GATEWAY_RESOURCES_FILE=/PRIVATE/DIRECTORY/resource.json \
  bt-gateway-operator --config ctp-gateway-simnow-trading.example.yaml
```

SIGINT/SIGTERM stop the Gateway through its owner; stopping a strategy never stops the Gateway, and stopping the Gateway never cancels or re-sends a strategy's orders. While the Gateway is unreachable, strategies wait or refuse; they never fall back to direct mode.
